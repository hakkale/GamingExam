# UnityExam

Here you can find Unity 2D platformer game example. Unfortunately, developer of the project were too lazy and unprofessional, so he left couple of issues in the game. 
Your task is to fix that issues, or maybe add the required functionality.

### Prerequisites
* Install UnityHub
* Install Unity version 2021.3.2f1
* Install VisualStudio Or Rider
* Download the project from this repository
* Open it from Unity (UnityHub->Add(Open) Project)
* Go to Scenes folder and double click on "ExamScene"

Now you can start and explore the project

Below you can see the list of items that need to be done:
* At start player is summoned, he can walk, but he is stuck on his first obstacle. The boxes doesn't move from the way
* Then Player on some point falls off for some reason.
* Also Player meets fire trap, but he cannot jump. We see some jump code in the project, but have no idea what to do with it.

If you reach this point, it is already very good. Please just submit your fixed project to keshishyanv@gmail.com (via google drive, project is big). Or Telegram

Additionaly, there is boss in the end, whom we can't kill, because shooting is not done here. You can fix it if you are interested.
